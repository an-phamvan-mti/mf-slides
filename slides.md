# What is a Micro-Frontend?

## <img src="imgs/1.png"/>

<p>Micro-Frontends Architecture consists of 3 main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
 <b>Micro-Frontends</b> (in the example the Button from MFE1 is a Micro-Frontend)
</li>
<li><b>A Host/Container </b>(in the example MFE2 was the host)</li>

<li><b>Micro-Frontend framework</b>: We used Webpack 5 Module Federation Plugin for that</li>
</ul>

---

# Why Micro Frontends?

The Micro-Frontends architecture was introduced to solve multiple issues with the current SPA frontend development

Here are some of the benefits of Micro-Frontends

<li> Team Scalability: Multiple teams can work independently to contribute to multiple systems</li>
<li>Single responsibility: This Will allow each team to build components with a single responsibility</li>
<li>Reusability: We will be able to use code in multiple places</li>
<li>Technology agnosticism: Micro Frontends architecture is independent of technology</li>
<li>Learning Curve: For new engineers joining the teams, it is easier to learn smaller apps than understanding a monolith with thousands of lines of code</li>
<li>Domain-Driven Architecture: One of the main reasons behind inventing both Micro-Frontends and Microservices is allowing vertical domain ownership</li>

# How to implement Micro-Frontends?

The main key in Micro-Frontends is the integration between the host/container and Micro-Frontends. There are two ways to integrate Micro-Frontends

## <li>Build-Time integration</li>

## <li>Run-Time integration</li>

---

# Build-Time integration

<p>
This is what most of the code implemented today. The container will install the components as libraries, similar to the libraries you install from npm
</p>
<li>
The size of the final package will be big because it contained all dependencies
</li>
<li>
Syncing different versions of libraries and build issues</li>
<li>We have to deploy again for any changes in dependencies</li>
---

# Run-Time integration

Has 3 types of Compositions:

<li>Server-Side Composition</li>
<li>Edge-Side Composition</li>
<li>Client-Side Composition</li>
<br>

# Run-Time integration

# What are different Frameworks available for Micro-Frontends?

Micro-Frontends is new, and frameworks are evolving. There are several frameworks in the market today

 <p><b>1. Webpack Module Federation:</b> allows JavaScript applications to dynamically import code from another application at runtime from different URLs. Webpack provides Build-time and Run-time integrations without the need for a server</p>
<p><b>
2. Bit: </b> is a Build-Time integration Framework. Bit provides a full framework, including CI/CD pipeline</p>
<p><b>3. Single-SPA: </b> is similar to Module Federation. Actually, you can use it with Module Federation. It is Run time integration. Single-SPA will take care of most of the Webpack configurations for you. It is a good solution if you do not want to dive deep into Webpack configurations</p>
<p>3. SystemJS</p>
<p>4. Piral</p>
<p>5. Open Components</p>
<p>...</p>

# Recommend the solution

<p style="color:red;font-weight: bold;">Single SPA + Federated Modules = Wow!</p>
<p>Single SPA also gives the ability to:</p>
<li>Deploy independently</li>
<li>Perform lazy loading</li>
<li>Introduce new frameworks without any modification for an existing app</li>
<p>With single-spa, you have two options for choosing the ecosystem for sharing dependencies:</p>
<p><li><b>Import maps:</b> are not supported in all browsers</li></p>
<p><li><b>Module federation in Webpack 5:</b>The main purpose of it is to share code and libraries between applications</li></p>

# Next.js Multi Zones

https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/multi-zones

- A zone is a single deployment of a Next.js app. You can have multiple zones and merge them as a single app.
- For example, let's say you have the following apps:
  - An app for serving `/blog/**`
  - Another app for serving all other pages
- With multi zones support, you can merge both these apps into a single one allowing your customers to browse it using a single URL, but you can develop and deploy both apps independently.
- Can be used in conjunction with micro-frontend

---

# Multi Zone pros

- Faster than micro-frontend
  - Next.js will preload your apps in the background to make them load faster.
  - Preloaded app will load just like they are in the same app with host app, users will feel like they are using a single app.
  - Since both apps are make with Next.js, they share runtime modules.
- Both apps can be deployed independently.
- We can use micro-frontend to share the `shell` between apps.
- Simpler config than microfrontend meaning easier to maintain, more stable.
- Doesn't need to worry about caching compared to Micro-frontend.

---

# Multi Zone cons

- Boths app must be developed with Next.js

---

# Proposed development strategy

- Create private npm repositories to share commonly used packages (components,...) between apps, this can help us maintain them separately.
- Use single-spa as a router for mf and use module federation to load and share Domain modules.
- Expose the `shell` (Layouts,Navbar,...) from the Main App with Module-Federation.
- Develop other Domain apps:
  - If we can make them as pages (Booking page, Inbound page,Outbound page,...) (Recommended) then make them Multi Zone apps and config Main App to load.
  - If they are only components then use single-spa and Module Federation to load them.
